## The Rise of Futures Trading Platforms

Since the launch of the first futures trading platform, BitMEX, in 2014, the market has expanded rapidly. According to Coingecko, there are now 27 cryptocurrency exchanges globally offering futures trading. This figure doesn't even include many smaller platforms that are surfacing in countries like China.

### The Decline of the Big Three: Can They Regain Dominance?

In September 2019, Binance launched perpetual futures, disrupting the dominance of the "Big Three" futures platforms: BitMEX, OKX, and Huobi.

#### **BitMEX: A Former Giant**

BitMEX was once the largest Bitcoin futures trading platform globally. Known for its deep liquidity and low trading fees, it dominated the market for years. However, repeated outages and legal issues have tarnished its reputation. For instance, on May 19th, 2020, the platform experienced a major outage lasting over an hour, leaving traders unable to operate. These issues have led to growing uncertainty about BitMEXâ€™s future.

According to Skew's latest data, BitMEX ranked fourth in 24-hour BTC futures trading volume at $2.17 billion, trailing behind Huobi ($4.08 billion), OKX ($3.93 billion), and Binance ($3.54 billion).

#### **Huobi and OKX: The Resilient Contenders**

Despite market disruptions, Huobi and OKX continue to perform strongly. Huobi quickly rose to the top spot in futures trading volume just three months after launching its perpetual futures. However, both Huobi and OKX faced challenges during extreme market events like the infamous "Black Thursday" in March 2020. Issues such as outages and forced liquidations led to user frustrations, raising concerns about whether these platforms are prioritizing user experience.

#### **Binance: The New Challenger**

In 2019, Binance acquired JEX, a cryptocurrency derivatives platform, and introduced dual futures contracts. Despite controversies like manipulated charts and premature liquidations, Binance managed to carve out a significant share of the futures market, now ranking third in trading volume.

## Second-Tier Exchanges: Rising Stars

Facing the uncertainties of top-tier platforms, second-tier exchanges like Bybit, Bitget, and FTX are steadily gaining ground. These platforms focus on user experience and innovative features, catering especially to beginner traders.

### **Bybit: The Overseas Player**

Bybit is popular among European users, with only 20% of its user base in Asia. Known for its clean user interface and strong product performance, Bybit has recently expressed interest in expanding into the Chinese market. However, its limited selection of futures products and intense market competition may hinder its growth in the region.

### **Bitget: The Dark Horse**

Bitget has emerged as a "dark horse" in the futures trading space. Its excellent user experience and customer service have attracted many beginner traders. The platformâ€™s "copy trading" feature, which allows users to replicate the strategies of experienced traders, has been widely praised. Despite its success, Bitget's lack of cross-margin functionality limits its appeal to advanced traders.

### **FTX: A Mixed Bag**

FTX, launched in 2019, has gained significant traction, achieving record-high daily ETH futures trading volumes in early 2020. However, allegations of misusing customer funds have damaged its reputation. Additionally, its lack of a mobile app makes it less appealing to retail investors accustomed to mobile-first platforms.

## Beware of Unregulated Exchanges

While second-tier exchanges strive to improve user experience, smaller unregulated platforms pose significant risks. These "black market" platforms often operate under false pretenses, using questionable tactics to exploit unsuspecting users.

### **Red Flags of Untrustworthy Platforms**

1. **Safety Concerns:** Are funds secure? Does the platform have transparent operations?
2. **Ease of Use:** Is the platform intuitive and easy to navigate?
3. **Market Manipulation:** Are there signs of price manipulation, such as excessive slippage or "scam wicks"?

Users are advised to choose established, regulated platforms and avoid obscure exchanges with unclear credentials. Always compare real-time futures prices and liquidity with mainstream exchanges to identify potential issues.

## The Future of Futures Trading

The competition in the cryptocurrency futures market is far from over. As exchanges continue to battle for dominance, the platforms that prioritize compliance, transparency, and user satisfaction are likely to emerge victorious. For retail investors, thorough research and cautious decision-making remain key to navigating this rapidly evolving market.
